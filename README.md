# S-LIBRE
 S-Libre is a platform that allows students to create and share learning materials like technical topics and tutorial videos. Students can rate the quality of each course material to help others find high-quality resources. The materials with the highest likes are displayed first. By using S-Libre, students can help each other learn and succeed!

 # Projectâ€™s Purpose or Goal
The purpose of this application, S-LIBRE, is to enable technical students to share materials such as videos, topics, and books. The applications also allow them to leave comments, like, leave a review and follow the various topics available. This will help create a sense of community to students who oftentimes do not yet have an active social network. For the students who are shy, it will also help them interact with more people thus also building their social skills and helping them get out of their comfort zone. For the students who do not have a network that matches their interest, this application will help them connect with people who share similar interests.
